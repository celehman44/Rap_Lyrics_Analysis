gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes\nHopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business\nWas once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders\nBut since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships\nWatchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor\nHow could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse\nDrivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'\nRed stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones\nFuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex\nAnd spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des\nGot guns when I'm with my daughter\nHate to bring a violent aura in her presence\nShe knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons\nBlack princess it's a ugly world\nI put my life up for yours, see I love that girl\nCould you believe even my shadow's jealous\nMy skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones\nMy brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs\nThough my songs come from the Father\nI'm lonely...\nHold me, it's gettin' darker\n\n[Chorus: Blitz]\nFor ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto\nFor every nigga totin' inner pain and heavy metal\nFor every child that's born, and every nigga gone\nAnd for every breath

reign, not in scorn or vain\nBut to take on a name, my pops chose for me\nBloodstream full of indo, developing eyes\nNine-months process, infant size\nA prophet in his early stages, mother in her

name, my pops chose for me\nBloodstream full of indo\nDeveloping eyes\nLooking out my belly button window\nMy father's size\nOn his face he wears a frown\nAnd I'm wondering if they even want me around\nCause I'll go back to spirit town\nSo I could rest longer before I come back down\nThe chute again, in the near future when\nMy moms and pops can agree on this\nWas here before but my moms saw her gynocologist\nHe dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont\nYou got 120 days do what you want\nBut as for me coming back this be my last time\nAbort me, keep me, give me

cord choking me\nBut month 3 was closer, see\nThats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic\nBut I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute\nWatching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well\nFeared fist fights, so terrified when we fell\nWhile they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall\nI wondered if I am born will I be safe at all\nThis place they call the world through my view was so large\nCouldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge\nMonth 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July\nBut the Lord already figured out a date and time\nSeptemeber 14th, '73\nGet ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me\nArms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop\nSee how the goverment will start re-training cops\nMonth 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced\nPops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too\nSaid stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on\nSurgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out\nEverything

streets\nTasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat\nThough I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive\nAs odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is\nTo maintain, bitches

decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me\nI ain't your mark homey\nIt's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake\nSpilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes\nCould hardly look both ways, put out the haze blurry vision\nThink about the time in my life before I was in televison\nHella women, jealous niggas up in my vision\nSince we all hood niggas expect kilos\nFor what they not seeing is police expect Rico\nOnly if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated\nWindows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me\nI hate it when I'm like this\nThe bottle's my

what was true\nOr what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately\nChoosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again\nTo keep my mind off that weak shit\nThere's love through it all, things to live for\nI swerve, almost crash into a wall\nThink about the good, find myself laughing\nTurn the cell off, no way to be reached\nKnow I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the

I know that feeling, that frustration with life and needing to take it out on someone, any one. But....\n\nWe chose the dumbest things to go the hardest for. I remember seeing deaths over 8 ball jackets, Fila sneakers, and name plate chains. Deaths over \"he say, she say\"!!!!! \"I'm from this block or I'm from that block\", or \"my moms n pops is f*cked up now the whole world gotta pay\"!!!\n\nI remember feeling like I was the hardest \"n*gga\" breathing. And I couldn't wait to prove it. But let's think. What are we really proving?? And proving what to who?? Everybody knows Chicago breeds the strongest of the strong but I just feel, me, being ya brother from another state feels your pain as if I grew up with you in ya very own household.\n\nYou have the ability and mindpower to change they way we are looked at. Look who's watching us young warriors, look who's throwing us in jail constantly, look at the ignorance in the world. Look at the racist dogs who love to see us down. Loving to bury us in the ground or in jail where we continue this worthless war on one another.\n\nYoung warriors.... We are WASTING more and more time. We gotta get on our jobs and take over the world. Cuz this movie left the theaters years ago, Juice, Menace, Boyz n the Hood , Blood n Blood Out, Belly!\n\nWhen we see each other why do we see hatred? Why were we born in a storm, born soldiers, WARRIORS....and instead of building each other up we are at war with each other.. May the soul of this young person find peace with the almighty. I'm with you young warriors. You're me and I'm you.

And apologies in advance for the typos as I am speaking from the heart as a man who has had enough.\nToday i got a call from essence about my ex wife doing another sad fictitious story. Nothing surprises me anymore, including this.\nThis is what your life has come to sis?\nExploiting some people\u2019s Real struggle and pain...just to get at me....to get attention ? Fame? Another fight against men? We are a human family and we should be better examples for our son. Why is there even a issue for me to have time with my son. A son needs his father. So many absentee fathers out here and here i am being attacked by your accusations simply because i got us in court to help fix this the custody matter?\nWhy did i have to take you to court to see our son? Why when i win the joint custody ( which is a win for both of us and our son, it helps us with both our schedules) why do you feel thats an attack on you? Is it control ? Why do you need to have control over my life? because we\u2019re not together? Then why? Is this being rewarded and praised by people who are being taken advantage of by you and your lies?\nTo all separated couples out there who are cordial and co parent nicely GOOD FOR YOU. I wish that was me. I\u2019m the most chill cool parent there is. Who has time to argue ? About what? It\u2019s about our little guy. You haven\u2019t had to deal with what I\u2019ve been dealing with. Trust me.\nI\u2019m a mild mannered god fearing very fair human being who tries his hardest to please everyone. It\u2019s my nature.\nI\u2019ve seen this too many times before\nAnd there was times i thought Kelis my ex wife was not this type. This is the type of antics that deceive people and people mistakenly call it strong. Seems I always had more belief in you than you do for yourself. I instilled strength in my daughter who you were already so jealous of and treated poorly. Being jealous & verbally abusive to a Little girl.\n\n[Part 2:]\nIn life you have to work hard to be successful, not try to tear someone down for that\u2019s the most coward way. Women are the essence of life. I cherish them. My strength is given to me from my mother. I am everything she taught me to be. I was raised in a single home by a single woman. I am a very proud black man.\nI shouldn\u2019t have ignored the signs from your your first song and video I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW. But I thought you was beautiful. You came into my life at a time i was grieving from my moms passing. You was a friend. Because of that i wanted to marry you. And i did. And we had a big lavish wedding. Overall there was too many good times. I have to say i wasn\u2019t the most faithful husband. I was immature. I\u2019m sorry about that. But you bumped your own head sis.\nWhy do i have to live thru a constant divorce? It didn\u2019t work out. Life goes on. I\u2019m not coming back to you. Your married and im happy for you and I\u2019m a extremely happy black brother out here trying to make a difference for my kids and the next generation of young people who see me as huge inspiration in music, art,business, education and so on.\nAfter 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent Attacks on me right outside your house THIS YEAR while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window, it was my weekend and you denied me that because your parents were in town. I just went home. This has been my life for my son\u2019s entire life. Even our son wonders why you treat me the way you do?\n\n[Part 3:]\nThere\u2019s some seriously crazy things i won\u2019t i disclose for our son\u2019s sake.\nBecause you keep my son from me ive been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit I\u2019m tired of it. I\u2019m tired of you painting a bad picture of me. I\u2019ve been tired of it but you never seem to get tired.\nI even had to be in a relationship with you AGAIN after we separated just so i could see my son & I AM JUST TIRED.\nBack then you asked me why didn\u2019t i stop the divorce from happening. I tried! We are too different. Some things aren\u2019t meant to be. We were meant to be so that we could have our son. Nothing more. You didn\u2019t like that. I prayed for your peace of mind for years because of your uneasy soul. I still do. I guess some things take time. You definitely don\u2019t know me now and probably never knew me. You make up this image of me that\u2019s not true but it\u2019s funny because it\u2019s really you describing yourself. You made up stories about me and claimed i did things that YOU DID.\nI hate all this, but you were a very jealous wife, and i had to deal with that and that\u2019s the worst feeling. How much heat i had to take from producers, writers, music attorneys and record execs etc who felt your mean spirited wrath and dropped you from labels, from startrack to them all. I stopped talking to jungle & steve stoute because of you & almost lost Anthony because of you.\n\n[Part 4:]\nYou used to turn my phone off so my professionals couldn\u2019t reach me and take the battery. You insulted any and everyone whoever was around me. Not a single person in my life loved or could even stand you. Luckily for you our assistants all signed NDA\u2019s or you would have a list of men and women who would happily talk about how verbally abusive and evil you are. Your self saboteur ways has caused you your grief your dealing with. Not me. The altercations you speak of are no more different from what most normal couples go thru, but your exaggerated version is UNJUST. Whenever one is constantly attacked the instinct is to restrain that person or defend yourself to prevent escalation. In hindsight now my advice to young men out there in a situation like that is to RUN at the very first sign of verbal abuse or physical. I herd you said terrible things about me. It makes me feel sad how heartless you can be. You play with strong women\u2019s struggles like they mean nothing. You\u2019re taking advantage of a moment in time where women who are fighting for their lives to get justice and be treated fairly & you just looked at it as an opportunity to get ahead. Like abuse is a game? Like tearing down your son\u2019s father is a game. You have a son! Why are you still competing with me by telling him bad things about me. Guess what sis, he has eyes and ears and smart as ever. i don\u2019t have to say anything. I think he knows what\u2019s really good. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. You tell him GOD doesn\u2019t love his dad because his dad doesn\u2019t goto church.\n\n[Part 5:]\nDidn\u2019t want to bring up money but since that\u2019s the fuel behind all of this Let me say that I gave you the tools to be successful after you was dropped from your label. I paid for your cooking school cordon blue.\nThe expensive yellow stove we had flown in from Europe. I helped pay for the remodeling of your house. Your assistant stole thousands from my cc according to Amex. Out of all people you should be completely understanding of my my grind. But you just can\u2019t win with you. My schedule is CRAZY but you never help me see my son. I\u2019m hardly allowed to talk to him on the phone. Ever.\nMy lawyer told me bring the cops to your house and show my court orders when you don\u2019t let me get him or answer your phone but who besides you wants to show their kids that his parents are that out of control? I\u2019ve been going thru lawyers to stop you from this bullshit for years. I finally got our custody together to work with both our schedule thru court, while leaving court you tell me your gonna get me back for fighting to see my son and 3 weeks later you\u2019re on camera doing an interview about \u201cyour truth\u201d. Interesting timing. Do what you want just don\u2019t violate another court order sis because the judge won\u2019t like that at all. The judge already ordered you to pay my legal fees because he was tired of you wasting everyone\u2019s time in court. No lawyer wants to represent you after what you put them thru. That\u2019s why you texted me today asking me for more child support money-and you want to keep it out court. You will NOT stop me from fighting for my son. Remember GOD sees all. And I\u2019m no longer allowing you to take advantage of the fact that I did not want to respond in a manner that could affect my kids , friends or family publicly. THAT ENDS TODAY.\n\n[Part 6:]\nEverything with her is a plot and a scheme. Has no merit. No foundation\nI didn\u2019t Wana speak up because i have real respect for our women. And definitely my son. I do not beat women. I did not beat up my ex wife. Stop. You got beat up in court. How much money do you want? Do you want me to relinquish my rights to see my son is that what you want? Just tell me. After all the tweets and posts you made thru the years disrespecting me and my family I still have love for you as the mother of my child BUT I am done with this. This game ends now and GOD will be the judger of all this. And although you tell everyone GOD hates me (some Christian you are) I will survive and thrive from this moment because I know who I am & you have not a clue who you are.\n\n[Part 7:]\nAnd to all the fans that knew my silence was due to the fact that I don\u2019t openly do this kind of petty shit... I appreciate you riding. And to those that were lead down a wrong path... I get it... very sensitive times and all things must be taken seriously. This is MY TRUTH. And I don\u2019t care what else she has left to say unless it concerns our son. This is the first and last time I\u2019m addressing this.
