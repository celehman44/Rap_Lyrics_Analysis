we was all framed\nBut the game is the game, so let it begin\nIn these streets, these are the seven deadly sins\nNow, the first is pride, though some call it vanity\nA hustler's insanity can break up the family\nPride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change\nKnowing that he'll end up in a grave\nIt's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans\nMesses up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting\nLike the second is something we all have\nOr felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath\nI seen a boss take it out on his staff\nSeen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath\nNever seen a man making money while he mad\nSo hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math\nNow the third, you probably heard from MOP\nThey say use them rocks to make 'em envy\nEnvy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it's a felony\nWhen niggas fucking with you [?] commit infidelity\nThey hate it, to see you celebrated\nCounting my paper, nigga, you could have made it\nLet me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth\nWhere niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth\nWant you to break em off, getting money it costs\nFor you to be a boss, ain't no taking off\nNow the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat\nIt\u2019s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street\nIt\u2019s a dude that\u2019s getting paid in full, cars and jewels\nSo his plate is full, but the way this nigga move\nHe is never full and he gon' want your food\nDon't overdo it, that's an underrated rule\nThe sixth is a fix that's in all of us\nWhen I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust\nWhen the drawers go down, the guards go down\nCause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now\nOkay, the seventh is a seed that many believe\nIs the cause of 'em all, this is what we call greed\nKnew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other\nGreed is a mother, it\u2019s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff\nCops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off\nBefore I sign off, in the sins we livin'\nThe good thing is we can be forgiven\n\n[Outro]\nSeven deadly sins", "year": "2014-07-22"}, {"artist": "Common", "album": "Music Inspired By the Motion Picture Wild Wild West ", "title": "8 Minutes to Sunrise", "lyrics": "[Common]\nYeah, yo, yo, yo-yo, yo, yo\nYo, a touch of jazz y'all, yeah, yeah\n?? y'all, yo they got us on the run, like\n\n[Jill Scott]\n8 minutes to sunrise\nOh baby now, what are we gonna do?

language, it's so hard trying to understand\nUsually after sex, it's a good feel\nTook by silence, emotion stood still\nI could feel, her tears spill from her grille\nHurt from before that began to build\nShe told me hold me, a story she assembled it\nTellin' it, trying not to remember it\nIt was a story of innocence taken\nThought she could redeem, through love makin'\nWhen she was eight she was raped by her father\nAnd tried to escape through multiple sex partners\nFelt pitiful, she had only learned\nTo love through the physical, inside it burned\nMy heart turned, I thought of what this

she found freedom between me and you\n\n[Hook: Cee-Lo]\nSometimes I wish a, careless whisper\nSerenade her, without speaking a word\nBecause of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer\nI feel so alive

life of one so given early would God take it?\nHurt she placed in, hope and prayer\nHurt she placed in chemo and lost hair\nI stare with my eyes closed\nWonder when the body leave does the mind go\nWatchin' Jordan became less important\nSeeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs\nAccording to doctors theres no cure\nWe went through doubt, and cases of insure\nWish I knew then how to heal with herbs\nKnew a part of her I could heal with words\nBut the creator was sending for her\nWhat seemed like the end was the beginning for her\nLike that, she didn't want us to remember her\nNo more

you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now\n\n[Chorus]\nNow, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place\nIt ain't a bunch of niggas all up in your face\nThe music is thumpin and

interpret point stars and half moons\nThen end up on garages or walls in bathrooms\nEvery black moon, a rap tune move me\nThe rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played\nIt don't stop\nIt's time to get it, get it made\nI got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face\nI know how the underground tastes\nI want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace\nGet down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers\nColder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin\nLinkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years\nFulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now\n\n[Chorus]\nI can feel the funk\n\nI came through the corridor, with the aura\nRaw Chicago mora, scope the horror\nRead between the lines and know the border\nSome pop wines for

wack feather\nThe Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather\nI rap better than you, you, or maybe him\nBut I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb\nSpilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly\nSome be so high, they believe they fly like R.

I ain't know our history was purposely hidden\nDamn, something in me wanna know who I am\nSo I began my search, my journey started in church\nIt gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief\nHustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets\nTaught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with\nAnd I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school\nIt almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal\nTakin' elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran\nSearched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites\nHold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White\nSome leads were granted with insight\nAnd it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand\nHe still created with the imperfection of man\nSo, with following I disagree\nBy no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but\nI do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind\nThat's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas\nYou gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity\nBut one side you gonna have to choose\nAny chance to speak I refuse to misuse\nSo how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession\nBecome an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson\nIf a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\nIf you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own\n\n[Hook]\nI've lived and

I think it's about time I give you some answers\n\n[MIGO]\nWhat is this?\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nYou see, Migo\nThere was a time when Yetis lived beneath the clouds\nWe were alive and we were thriving till we came across a crowd\nOf Smallfoot, that's right, we used to live down there\nBut there were actions we could not forgive down there\nAnd though they used a different nomenclature\nMan, or human, they showed us human nature\nA dangerous species that we approached with wonder\nThey attacked with spears and their smokin' sticks of thunder\nThey called us Sasquatch, they called us abominable\nThey chased us, pursed us, their persistence indomitable\nWe had no choice but to run and hide\nOtherwise, we surmised we were facin' genocide\nSo we climbed this mountain just to stay alive\nYou see we knew that up here Smallfoot cannot survive\nSo it was here the first law was written in stone\nIt was named and proclaimed as a truth to be known\nOur world is an island, it floats on a sea of endless clouds\nThat's how we would be\nAnd then we wrote more laws, more rules to obey\nFor the sake of us all it was the only way\nTo protect us from all of the human ravages\nHeaped upon us by those human savages\n\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n(Now you know, now you know)\nAnd new rules apply\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\nThat it's best just to let it lie\n\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\n(Now you know, now you know)\nAnd you can't deny\n(Now you know, now you know, now you know)\nThat it's best just to let it lie\n\n[MIGO]\nBut my Smallfoot, he's not like that\n\n[THE STONEKEEPER]\nThey're all like that.

say it's lust\nBustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust\nOr is it that we don't trust each other enough\nAnd believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together\nGirl I want you in

can't say that they wives\nI wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding\nBut I want our parenthood to come from planning\nIt's so much in my life that's undone\nWe gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one\nIf you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from\nBut I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God\nSo I can, discipline my son with my rod\nNot have a judge

was tired quick\nThat's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick\nThings got worse before they got better\nI said, \"Come to L.A. for peace and good weather\"\nWe got an apartment just so we could spark it\nMP in the front room, records in the closet\nThe beats got iller, but the sickness was still there\nI'm wishing I could will him out of his wheelchair\nIt was hard for me to come home every day\nAnd see my homie Jay's life fade away\nI stayed away some times, in other words I ran\nTil one day J brought me this TV stand\nIt was a gift so I couldn't refuse it\nIt came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it\nThe lupus got worse and, for what it's worth\nI wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth\nWishing we could have that time back\nOh we can, yo man, rewind

perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels\nIt's unseen or heard, a king with words\nCan't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred\nDark spots in my mind where the scene occured\nSome say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep\nThrough me, Muhammad will forever speak\nGreet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes\nWhere a man is determined by how much a man make\nCop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats\nWith cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear\nUnder the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped\nWant to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap\nRan so far from the streets that you can't come back\nYou tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that\n\n[Chorus]\n\"This is rap for real, something you feel\"\n\"And you know, yes you know\"\n\"Rap for the black people\"\n\"Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries\nInspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes\nI'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies\nImmortalized by the realness I bring to it\nIf revolution had a movie I'd be theme music\nMy music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it\nMy life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it\nThrough my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions\nMore than money saved, I wanna save children\nDealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity\nA complex man drawn off of simplicity\nReality is frisking me\nThis industry will make you lose intensity\nThe Common Sense in me remembers the basement\nI'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit\n\n[Chorus]\n\"This is rap for real, something you feel\"\n\"And you know, yes you know\"\n\"Rap for the black people\"\n\"Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nSomedays I take the L to gel with the real world\nGot on at 87th, sat by this little girl\nShe recited raps, I forgot where they was from\nIn 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum\nI start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected\nHow many dead folks this art resurrected\nHow many nations this culture connected\nWho am I to judge one's perspective?\nThough some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating\nIf I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating\nI just want to innovate and stimulate minds\nTravel the world and penetrate the times\nEscape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom\nRaps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em\nFor now I appreciate this moment in time\nBall players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like\n\n[Chorus]\n\"This is rap for real, something you feel\"\n\"And you know, yes you know\"\n\"Rap for the black people\"\n\"Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy\"",

Obama, Oprah and Rosa\nThe mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier\nHoods feel safer, families feel closer\nWe all drunk in love with no need to be sober\nLadies get their hair done, and men, we notice\nYou get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest\nPrices, chivalry is no longer lifeless\nWe openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again\nThings are merry and there's more marryin'\nMonthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian\nFor your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows\nDepictin' women as ignorant simple hoes\nIt's more love songs on the radio\nRespect for the ladies, you can hear it in the

the, cover of Ebony\nBut this is somethin special we ain't tryna exploit\nWit a couple a actresses, now I'm in the tabloids\nLike bad boys, real love moves in silence\nAbout out bih'ness, family bih'ness stay private\nDon't sweat the small stuff girl, cause we both giants\nI looked into your eye's and I see divine vibrance\nThe way that Prince, Minnie Rip' and Joni Mitch' described it\nA

tip\nWriting thank you notes just like James and Frank did\nHold up, yo, bring the style back\nJust like you got hijacked\nOn cloud nine with it, girls reachin' they climax\nI'm larger than life, I'm like the imax\nThe baddest rapper she's heard of\nMatter fact I take it three further\nCheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger\n\n[Verse 3: Common]\nCommon sense yo I'm with the roots crew\nHip-hop, hip-hopping like a kangaroo\nWhat can I do yo, I can't hold back\nCall me kangaroo jack or kangaroo black\nBlack thought yo, we all sorta driving\nUnderstand Com Sense I'm always soul surviving\nComing clean I don't even need the green\nI'm in the green you see me in the limousine\nAnd we be on the team\nYo, I got this sheen like my man Questlove with the afro\nSometimes I battle sometimes I straddle formality\nCommon Sense I'm the realest in virtual reality\nComin' real with this type of style  from the Stoney Isle\nOnly child, yo I'm with Jimmy Fal'\nHoldin' down the

of men, we walk on all fours\nHeart opened and heart closed\nEvery now and then she sparkles\nYou can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose\nI'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose\nEven when the door close, there grows a new one\nI told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one\nHer daddy left a hole because she never really knew him\nOk, sometimes from commitment, we do run\nRocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian\nI'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision\nBut not to be married with kids she was wishing\nShhh, 'til your soul just listen\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Common]\nShe said daddy take me ice-skating\nLooking at the rear-view, life's waiting for her\nGotta be there to support her\nCan't really wait for a court order\nShe got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant\nA lot of love inside, got to help guide it\nDaddy will protect it, God will provide it\nWe all will be there so your soul ain't divided\nMan, how quick she grows\nLooking like her momma but she got my toes\nI suppose it's the age that she really really need me\nA lot of girls without, they become needy\n\"Como on, Dad, I'm too old for the back seat\nCan you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?\"\nAs she begins the race of life and love I told her\n\"I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya\"\n\n[Hook]", "year":

a haiku when I was seventeen\nI used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream\nNow I\u2019m a Champagne King like Evelyn\nYoung hearts run free and forever sing\nYea\n\n[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]\nTell me what the fuck you on\nCause your heart is sayin\u2019 ohh, ohh, ohh \u2013 run\n\n[Hook: Common]\nState of the art, state of the drill\nState of the mind, state of the city\nI contemplate and rewind\nState of the art, state of the mind\nState of the city\nI contemplate and rewind\n\n[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]\nCause your heart is sayin\u2019 ohh, ohh, ohh \u2013 run\n\n[Hook: Common]\nState of the art, state of the drill\nState of the mind, state of the city\nI contemplate and rewind\nState of the art, state of the mind\nState of the city\nI contemplate and rewind\n\n[Common]\nIt was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed\nLove shed, \u2018nough said\n\n[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]\nBut I still wanna know\nWhat the fuck you\u2019re on\nCause your heart is sayin\u2019 ohh, ohh, ohh \u2013 run\nAnd I\u2019m down to jump the gun with you\nTell me what the fuck you want\nCause your heart is sayin\u2019 ohh, ohh, ohh \u2013 run\nAnd I\u2019m down to jump the gun with you\n\n[Verse 3: James Fauntleroy]\nWhat the fuck I\u2019m s\u2019posed to do, you not around\nI\u2019m not talkin' 'bout when you're high I mean on the ground\nAlways hold you down in and outta town\nMaybe I\u2019m a clown got me crying out in front the crowd\nOn the inside but it feel like a fuckin\u2019 cloud\nOut my fuckin\u2019 mind, I\u2019ma fuckin\u2019 drown\nGirl but I\u2019m not gonna fuck around\nI\u2019ma fuckin\u2019 marry you and learn to swim\nLet me carry you I need to hit the gym\nYoung hard jab but the difference is\nGot young love but I\u2019m not young\nFaith in love but I\u2019m not dumb\nI don\u2019t need to give a fuck about the outcome\nNiggas be scared but I\u2019m not one\n\n[Outro: James Fauntleroy]\nNiggas be scared but I\u2019m not one\nNiggas be scared but I\u2019m not one\nNiggas be scared but I\u2019m not one\nNiggas be scared but I\u2019m not one", "year": "2014-07-22"}]
