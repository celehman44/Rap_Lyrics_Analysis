I will post my progress\u2026 Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don\u2019t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We\u2019ll see\u2026\n\nBest of luck and health!\n\nP.S.

They were not afraid to be ahead of their audience, and I feel like that's what you try to do. I mean, this album is a lot about arts, and things that kids not necessarily would be interested in.\n\n[Jay Z]\nThe the truth is, as far as hip-hop and the arts, we were like cousins, you know. If you think about those days with Fab Five Freddy was with Madonna and Basquiat and everything. You know, we all went to those clubs--that\u2019s when hip hop was more underground. The arts and hip-hop really partied together, but when arts started becoming part of the gallery it was this separation. But we pretty much came up together.\n\n[Maher]\nYou have a song on your record called \u201cTom Ford.\u201d I'm sure some people are thinking, why is he on some white, gay designer\u2019s dick? What\u2019s going on there?\n\n[Jay Z]\nPause.\n\nLet me clarify that: I am not...[Laughs]\n\n[Maher]\nI meant that metaphorically. But the line that I think says alot, you say, \u201cI don\u2019t pop molly, I rock Tom Ford.\u201d You know, everybody else is talking about doing ecstasy, and you\u2019re, \u201cI don\u2019t do that; I get shit done. I\u2019m in business.\u201d\n\n[Jay Z]\nMan, I\u2019m just gonna take you around with me--\n\n[Maher]\nTo explain your shit?\n\n[Jay Z]\nYeah. Thank you. Thank you, sir.\n\n[Maher]\nIt could help you with Harry Belafonte. You had a feud. Show the picture. I mean, this is very bad what happened with the you and Harry because, I mean, look at look at this. He\u2019s 86, and you\u2019re 43? So he\u2019s literally twice your age and it\u2019s a draw.\n\nHe got on your case because he, I remember when they did this with Michael Jordan, you remember that, when they were saying to Michael Jordan: \u201cYou're the king of the negroes; get more involved, do more.\u201d And, you know, that upset you, and I don't blame you for being upset.\n\n[Jay Z]\nYeah, I just didn\u2019t think it was the correct venue. If it was something, really like a real problem, you know, I'm not a very difficult to find, especially for someone of that stature. He can reach out to me and we can have a conversation we\u2019ll do some good together. But, you know, I just thought that it was a bit of grandstanding to me, and I didn\u2019t appreciate especially dragging my wife into it was a bit of a low blow--\n\n[Maher]\nAnd Bruce Springsteen...\n\n[Jay Z]\nI really like Bruce Springsteen.\n\n[Maher]\nHarry was on our show once. He was iconic, as he is, and I don't know if you ever saw this clip, but I wanted to get it for you. This is from a 1968 television special he did with Petula Clark, and this was a giant controversy in 1968 because she touched him. Show the clip to show you what I'm talking about. This is what people we upset about.\n\nCan you imagine, that\u2019s where the country was? That just that she had his arm...and you see the look in his eyes, it's like, \u201cyou know, you dumb English broad, you\u2019re gonna get me lynched.\" I\u2019m just putting it in perspective; that\u2019s where he\u2019s coming from.\n\nI feel like a lot of this record is about the love/hate relationship you have with fame, certainly that first track, the title track.\n\n[Jay Z]\n\u201cHoly Grail,\u201d it\u2019s about acknowledging that you\u2019re dancing with this drug, you know, and that people have lost their lives behind it, you know, this fame thing, and where to draw the line and how to maintain a sense of yourself within it. We look at all the people that came before us who are no longer here with us, you know, have been in this dance with fame. And it\u2019s just me just really thinking out loud and vocalizing and hopefully dealing with it in some ways. It\u2019s sorta like my therapy.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda strange to have a conversation with like three people, like I'm ignoring y\u2019all. I gotta make eye contact.\n\n[Maher]\nAnd they\u2019re all gay, by the way.\n\n[Barney Frank]\nThink of us as your backup group in waiting.\n\n[Maher]\nWe\u2019ll bring them in in a few minutes.

So in seven years you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I'm sure you'll be getting in first ballot unless there's some steroids--\n\n[Jay Z]\nI am not going!\n\n[Maher]\nYou\u2019re not going?\n\n[Jay]\nNah, I\u2019m just--\n\n[Maher]\nYou\u2019ll be going. Who would you like to induct you?\n\n[Jay Z]\nUm, Obama.\n\n[Maher]\nWell...\n\n[Jay Z]\nI cheated.\n\n[Maher]\nLet\u2019s say he\u2019s busy...\n\n[Jay Z]\nIt\u2019ll be all right. He owes me, he owes me a couple.\n\n[Maher]\nHe owes me a couple.\n\n[...]\n\n[Bill Maher]\nI noticed that one of the talking points from conservatives after the Trayvon Martin trial was, why are we talking about this one tragedy when hundreds of black kids are being shot in Chicago. But over the weekend the Congressional Black Caucus did a two-day summit there, and they talked about this very issue the conservatives say they're never talking about. It was covered by NPR, MSNBC, Chicago media, C-SPAN, not Fox News. It seems like Fox News doesn't want to allow this fact in that they are actually talk--\n\n[Josh Barro]\nIt\u2019s total concern trolling.\n\n[Maher]\nWhat?\n\n[Barro]\nConcern trolling. It's, you know, saying, well you know shouldn't--don't worry about this thing, worry about this other thing, but you don't really care about the other thing you just wanna change the subject.\n\nAnd I think that the it's also bizarre to act like people don't care about violence in in inner cities or affecting black communities in the United States. I think it's a hugely important issue, especially in local politics where crime issues are actually dealt with. But it really it really is just an effort to change the subject.\n\n[Barney Frank]\nIt's also the case, and this goes back to our other argument, one of the things Republicans have been able to do is cut budgets, so there are a lot fewer police officers in every city in America. And social workers, and other people who might take a preventive kinda situation. And also, by the way, that\u2019s why unemployment is too high; we've created on a private sector jobs, but the Republican priorities have cut over a million have public sector jobs, and that\u2019s cops and others. So they\u2019ve caused that kind of problem by denying the cities the resources that they could use to try to do with the problem.\n\n[Alexis Goldstein]\nBut I think over-policing is part of the problem. I mean, look at New York City and look at stop and frisk. I mean, policing in communities of color...I mean, I don't know, I can\u2019t talk this better than you can, but I\u2019m curious or your opinion, Jay Z--\n\n[Jay Z]\nI don\u2019t really want to scare America, but the did the real problem is there's no middle class, right? So that the gap between have and have-nots is getting wider and wider.\n\n[Applause]\n\nLet me just finish this point because I do want to scare them a little bit: It's going to be a problem that no amount of police can solve, because, you know, once you have that sort of oppression, you know, and that gap is widening, it\u2019s inevitable that something is going to happen.\n\n[Frank]\nI agree with that, but that does not mean you don't need police in the short term, and I completely disagree: Stop-and-Frisk is an abuse of people\u2019s rights, but the African Americans I talk to, and that including those in Congress, don't want fewer police--they want better policing. But they want more policing. It\u2019s like Bill said, \u201cOh, the ambulance came very quickly because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth to it. So denying them the resources is the problem, the notion that because some police have misbehaved you want fewer police. I don't know any significant percentage in the African-American community...\n\n[Jay Z]\nWell, more jobs would be better than police. We won\u2019t need police...\n\n[Frank]\nYou need them both. I think, again, that\u2019s a mistake. More jobs, those are going to help, but in the short term people want police stations. We are very unfair to people live in public housing. It was built badly, and they were put in there, but they deserve much more protection. The overwhelming majority of perfectly innocent, honest people--\n\n[Jay Z]\nThey deserve to get out of there. Public housing was a temporary stop, right?\n\nI grew up in Marcy Projects; public housing was a temporary stop until you got yourself together, you moved on.\n\n[Frank]\nBut even if you\u2019re there for a couple years, you don\u2019t want to be unpoliced. I'm all for that, low-income affordable rental housing was my number one goal--it's another thing that the Republicans, through the Tea Party, have absolutely cut off, unfortunately--\n\n[Goldstein]\nBut I don\u2019t think Stop-and-Frisk is a few bad apples. That\u2019s an institutionalized racism that the NYPD has been conducting for years. They stopped more young black men than there are young black men in New York last year. I don\u2019t seem them stopping and frisking Wall Street bankers--they have tons of cocaine on them.\n\n[Jay Z]\nHahahahaha.\n\n[Frank]\nYou\u2019re fighting a straw man. Of course Stop-and-Frisk, the way they\u2019re doing it, is wrong, but answer is not fewer police. You hear people in the African-American community in New York complaining about Stop-and-Frisk, not get the cops outta here. They want the cops to be there and to be better behaved.\n\n[Barro]\nI think it's also important to remember: crime is still falling. We've had a massive improvement--\n\n[Maher]\nThe murder rate is at a hundred year low.\n\n[Barro]\nYeah, so I think you know inequality\u2019s a big problem in a number of ways, but a lot of people were afraid when we went to the recession in 2008 that the progress we\u2019d made on crime be reversed, and actually this is one social indicator that just keeps getting better.\n\n[Frank]\nAnd also black people are the primary victims of crime disproportionately, and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t want to see the police taken away. They want them improved but the answer is not to remove them.\n\n[Maher]\nIf the murder rate is at a hundred year low, why do we need to do so much stopping and frisking; why do we need drones with the police department; why we're building a wall in Mexico.

hopped out in a suit\nLook at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine\nI didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind\nPlus I'm puffin like an ounce more than I used to puff\nTaking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff\nThey had me thinking, \"Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff\nWhile he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff\"\nSwear to

should take him in back of the building and blaze him\nUh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe\nThat had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide\nTried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five\nHugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye\nIt woulda seemed we was the closest, but those that know us\nCould see that something was about to go down\nStay focused, I'm trying to concentrate\nBut it's like he's reading my mind\nAs if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind\nCould he see I had plans on, being the man\nEver since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand\nAnd I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause\nAs he approached (\"Whattup Bleek?\") and I paused\n\n[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z]\nI done came up (uhh), put my

But it was a fascinating moment to me. Rap, as I said at the beginning of the book, is at heart an art form that gave voice to a specific experience, but, like every art, is ultimately about the most common human experiences: joy, pain, fear, desire, uncertainty, hope, anger, love--love of crew, love of family, even romantic love (put on \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\" some time and tell me rap can't be romantic--or if you want to keep it street, put on Mary J. Blige and Method Man's \"I'll be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\"). Of course, in the end, it may not be the art form for you. Oprah, for instance, still can't get past the n-word issue (or the nigga issue, with all apologies to Ms. Winfrey). I can respect her position. To her, it's a matter of acknowledging the deep and painful history of the word. To me, it's just a word, a word whose power is owned by the user and his or her intention. People give words power, so banning a word is futile, really. \"Nigga\" becomes \"porch monkey\" becomes \"coon\" and so on if that's what's in a person's heart. The key is to change the person. And we change people through conversation, not through censorship. That's why I want people to understand what the words we use - and the stories we tell - are really about.\n\nAnd that's why I wrote this book. I love writing rhymes. There's probably nothing that gives me as much pleasure. There have been times in my life when I've tried to put it to the side--when I was a kid, so I could focus on hustling in the streets, and when I was an adult, so I could focus on hustling in the boardroom--but the words kept coming. They're still coming and will probably never stop. That's my story. But the story of the larger culture is a story of a million MCs all over the world who are looking out their windows or standing on street corners or riding in their cars through their cities or suburbs or small towns and inside of them the words are coming, too, the words they need to make sense of the world they see around them. The words are witty and blunt, abstract and linear, sober and fucked up. And when we decode that torrent of words \u2014 by which I mean really listen to them with our minds and hearts open \u2014 we can understand their world better. And ours, too. It's the same world.", "year": "2010-11-16"}, {"artist": "JAY-Z", "album": "Decoded (Excerpts)", "title": "Decoded: Part 1 (Excerpts)", "lyrics": "Part I\nMy life after childhood has two main stories: the story of the hustler and the story of the rapper, and the two overlap as much as they diverge. I was on the streets for more than half of my life from the time I was thirteen years old. People sometimes say that now I'm so far away from that life - now that I've got businesses and Grammys and magazine covers - that I have no right to rap about it. But how distant is the story of your own life ever going to be? The feelings I had during that part of my life were burned into me like a brand. It was life during wartime.On \"Public Service Announcement\"\n\neven when a rapper is just rapping about how dope he is, there\u2019s something a little bit deeper going on. It\u2019s like a sonnet, believe it or not. Sonnets have a set structure, but also a limited subject matter. They are mostly about love. Talking on such a familiar subject and writing about it in a set structure forced sonnet writers to find every nook and cranny in the subject and challenged them to invent new language for saying old things. It\u2019s the same with braggadacio in rap. When we take the most familiar subject in the history of rap -- why I'm dope -- and frame it within the sixteen bar structure of a rap verse, synced to the specific rhythm and feel of the track, more than anything it\u2019s a test of creativity and wit. It\u2019s like a metaphor for itself; if you can say how dope you are in a completely original, clever, powerful way, the rhyme itself becomes proof of the boast\u2019s truth. And there are always deeper layers of meaning buried in the simplest versesFrom Negative Space section\n\nHip-hop has always been controversial, and for good reason. When you watch a children's show and they've got a muppet rapping about the alphabet, it's cool, but it's not really hip-hop. The music is meant to be provocative - which doesn't mean it's necessarily obnoxious, but it is (mostly) confrontational, and more than that, it's dense with multiple meanings. Great rap should have all kinds of unresolved layers that you don't necessarily figure out the first time you listen to it. Instead it plants dissonance in your head. You can enjoy a song that knocks in the club or has witty punch lines the first time you hear it. But great rap retains mystery. It leaves shit rattling around in your head that won't make sense till the fifth or sixth time through. It challenges you\n\nWhich is the other reason hip-hop is controversial: People don't bother trying to get it. The problem isn't in the rap or the rapper or the culture. The problem is that so many people don't even know how to listen to the music\n\nSince rap is poetry, and a good MC is a good poet, you can\u2019t just half-listen to a song once and think you\u2019ve got it. Here\u2019s what I mean: A poet\u2019s mission is to make words do more work than they normally do, to make them work on more than one level. For instance, a poet makes words work sonically - as sounds, as music. Hip-hop tracks have traditionally been heavy on the beats, light on melody, but some MCs - Bone Thugs \u2018N Harmony, for example - find ways to work melodies into the rapping. Other MCs - think about Run from Run-DMC - turn words into percussion: cool chief rocka, I don\u2019t drink vodka, but keep a bag of cheeba inside my locka. The words themselves don\u2019t mean much, but he snaps those clipped syllables out like drumbeat, bap bap bapbap. It\u2019s as exciting as watching a middleweight throw a perfect combination. If you listened to that joint and came away thinking it was a simple rhyme about holding weed in a gym locker, you\u2019d be reading it wrong: The point of those bars is to bang out a rhythmic idea, not to impress you with the literal meaning of the words\n\nBut great MCing is not just about filling in the meter of the song with rhythm and melody. The other ways that poets make words work is by giving them layers of meaning, so you can use them to get at complicated truths in a way that straightforward storytelling fails to do. The word you use can be read a dozen different ways: They can be funny and serious. They can be symbolic and literal. They can be nakedly obvious and subliminally effective at the same time. The art of rap is deceptive. It seems so straightforward and personal and real that people read it completely literally, as raw testimony, or autobiography. And sometimes the words we use, nigga, bitch, motherfucker, and the violence of the images overwhelms some listeners, It\u2019s all white noise to them until they hear a bitch or a nigga and then they run off yelling \u201cSee!\u201d and feel vindicated in their narrow conception of what the music is about. But that would be like listening to Maya Angelou and ignoring everything until you hear her drop a line about drinking or sleeping with someone\u2019s husband and then dismissing her as an alcoholic adulterer\n\nBut I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever given much of a fuck about people who hear a curse word and start foaming at the mouth. The Fox News dummies. They wouldn\u2019t know art if it fell on them.", "year": "2010-11-10"}, {"artist": "JAY-Z", "album": "Decoded (Excerpts)", "title": "Decoded: Part 2 (Excerpts)", "lyrics": "Part 2: I WILL NOT LOSE\n\nWhat's the basic motivation for a hustler? I hit the streets for the same reason a lot of other kids do: I wanted money and excitement and liked the idea of cutting myself loose from the rules and low ceilings of the straight world. The truth is that most kids on the corner aren't making big money--especially if you break their income down into hourly wage.* But they're getting rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The kid on the streets is getting a shot at a dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustling thing pay off in a big way. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yep, that'll be me. He ignores the other stories going around, about dudes who get shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they're working that corner for more than whatever small cut they get of the crack they sell--they're working because they're due for a miracle. The kid in McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There's no dream in fast food. Manager? That's a promotion not a dream. It took me a long time to realize how much courage it took to work at McDonald's, to walk through the streets past rows of hustlers wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never even considered it a possibility.\n\nWhen you've got a nation of hustlers working for a small amount of slots, you learn something that you'll never learn at McDonald's. You learn to compete hard, even when you lose, because you can't settle for second-best as a hustler. It's not worth it. The only reason to do it is for the top slot, for the number one position... Sort of like the music business. *[The gang leader\u2019s] hourly wage was $66\u2026the foot soldiers earned just $3.30 an hour. In other words, a crack gang works pretty much like the standard capitalist enterprise: you have to be near the top of the pyramid to make a big wage\u2026so if crack dealing is the most dangerous job in America, and if the salary is only $3.30 an hour, why on earth would anyone take the job?\u201d\n--Steven D.

We're aware of the government from the time we're born. We live in government-funded housing and work government jobs. We have family and friends spending time in the ultimate public housing, prison. We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cards \u2014 Medicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food. We know what AFDC and WIC stand for and we stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese. The first and fifteenth of each month are times of peak economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of civics class, but because they actually visit our houses and sit up on our couches asking questions. From the time we're small children we go to crumbling public schools that tell us all we need to know about what the government thinks of us.\n\nThen there are the cops.\n\nIn places like Marcy there are people who know the ins and outs of government bureaucracies, police procedures, and sentencing guidelines, who spend half of their lives in dirty waiting rooms on plastic chairs waiting for someone to call their name. But for all of this involvement, the government might as well be the weather because a lot of us don\u2019t think we have anything to do with it--we don't believe we have any control over this thing that controls us. A lot of our heroes, almost by default, were people who tried to dismantle or overthrow the government--Malcolm X or the Black Panthers--or people who tried to make it completely irrelevant, like Marcus Garvey, who wanted black people to sail back to Africa. The government was everywhere we looked, and we hated it.\n\nHousing projects are a great metaphor for the government's relationship to poor folks: these huge islands built mostly in the middle of nowhere, designed to warehouse lives. People are still people, though, so we turned the projects into real communities, poor or not. We played in fire hydrants and had cookouts and partied, music bouncing off concrete walls. But even when we could shake off the full weight of those imposing buildings and try to just live, the truth of our lives and struggle was still invisible to the larger country.

We'd be a man short and he's supposed to be on our team, and we'd be waiting for him, and you'd go get him and he'd still be upstairs writing, and, reading dictionary's, understanding words and putting them together inside his head. In the projects you live in dog years right? I remember once this lady told me \"you guys might never live to be 21 years old.\" So at 14 or 15 years old you're damn near a grown man in your mind. You're doing things, you're hanging out all night, you might be carrying a gun, you might be selling drugs. You might have a car, you might be paying your parents rent and taking care of the household. So those years living the way you are to be 25 is like being 50. You have knowledge far past your youth. So as you get older you just accumulate more things, as you're learning more things. He just learned to play both sides of it. I remember we was driving down Nostrand Avenue one day. Listening to some music. And I was telling Jay \"Yo you need to be spitting such and such man, giving them some real knowledge\" and he was like \"Nope, it'd be too deep. I can't be too deep I have to spoon feed them. Everything I do I have to spoon feed them lightly. If I give them too much they won't take it. Once I spoon feed them lightly, feed them sugar feed them sugar, and then give them some knowledge on top of that, and then they'll take that in and start growing with you, and you know, follow me.\" So you know, he had the plan.\n\n[Musical interlude: \"Politics As Usual\"]\n\nTone Hooker: I remember one day we was chilling, and Dame told me yo think of a name for us as a rap crew. In ten minutes I wrote down ten little names. Roc-A-Fella happened to be the first name, and everybody was like \"yo that's a dope name.\" But Dame was like \"Why Roc-A-Fella, like what made you think of that?\" We rock fella's on stage, you guys are flashy guys, you're about getting money, cause the Rockerfeller's were known as a rich and powerful family, so we just took the name, changed the lettering a little bit, R.O.C., it went from just a game of a group of people to an actual record company. Reasonable Doubt showed a mentality of the bosses versus the runners. The irony is to this day everybody is a boss or trying to appear like Jay first appeared in that album, Reasonable Doubt, versus when in the 90s everyone just wanted to be the best rapper, now everybody wants to be the best hustler.\n\n[Musical interlude: \"Politics As Usual\"]\n\nKareem \"Biggs\" Burke: A lot of people just kind of glorified the hustling aspect of it. But if you really listen to Reasonable Doubt, he does glorify it, but at the end he shows the repercussions of it, so I think if they got the whole message, they can understand exactly why he's celebrating. Like this kid who father left him, and the environment around him and around all of us. There was always something, like Dame his mother died, his father left as a kid, and me being evicted when I was 10 years old, and living in a shelter for years. It was always that one thing in our lives that we had in common that we knew we wanted to take over the world and do something that's groundbreaking, and that's that drive that we had as we started to get older and see things and get in the business, and then having the money was always a celebration for us, but it was a celebration because of our circumstances, and I don't think people knew that. And it was always from the smallest to the tallest, like being able to get your first $100 pair of sneakers, being able to get your first bottle of champagne was a celebration. It's just that things kept growing for us, so we were celebrating all the time.\n\n[Musical interlude: \"Politics As Usual\"]\n\nKareem \"Biggs\" Burke: You know I am blown away by the talent and Jay lyricism, I'm blown away by what the producers have done. I'm blown away by the artwork, I mean Jonathon Mannion's career started from that right? He did Jay's next 8 albums, he did DMX, he's doing Kendrick now and Eminem, I'm seeing interns become execs right, these kids now who build businesses and want to be part of companies and want 50/50 ventures and want to build and buy and sell. And some of the millennials don't even know where that came from, I mean that came from us, from Reasonable Doubt. I mean it's a great feeling just to be a part of that. To know that we're a part of history. Jay right now have more number 1 albums than Elvis Presley, behind The Beatles, we didn't plan that. It's just a celebration.\n\nDJ Premier: I knew Jay already just from him with Jaz and we see each other in all the same hot spots, the fly spots where you wanted to get into where hip hop was underground, you had to be somebody to get in, you didn't have to be a platinum artist but you had to be somebody.\n\nKyambo \"Hip Hop\" Joshua: I basically met Jay through my brother Biggs. Kareem Burke when I was in high school. At a party he was performing at, we was on the line, and they basically told him \"Hey this is Biggs little brother\" and he said \"Well come with me\" and he basically took all of us off the line and we went into the club, and I've been with him ever since. Drinking Cristal the first time I was in the club.\n\nMemphis Bleek: I grew up just knowing him as Shawn from the 5th floor. I knew his moms, his sister, his nephews, I used to babysit his nephews, his mom used to pay me a few dollars, so I always known him. I used to get in trouble for hanging with him, cause my mom knew they was the dope boys, you too young to be with the dope boys.\n\nKyambo \"Hip Hop\" Joshua: I believe it was the first day they opened the office up, and then asked if I wanted a job. At one time I had the album and nobody in the world had it. I was about to graduate so I had to, it was rehearsals, and I just remember listening to it, like nobody knows what I'm hearing, nobody knows what's about to happen. I wish I could have took my headphones, flipped them around, and let the world hear it.\n\nMemphis Bleek: My favourite song on the album had to be \"D'Evils.\" Hands down, I stole a copy of the song I liked it so much. To where Jay and B High came to my apartment, like \"Yo I heard you giving out copies of this song, the word came back to you,\" they was ready to beat me up, drop me from even hanging with them cause they like \"you a thief\" but they didn't understand I needed that record for my soul, like you are talking to me.\n\nDJ Premier: When I DJ gigs now, soon as I drop \"D'Evils\" the crowd goes crazy. And they're singing it, I'm watching them in the crowds mouthing the words, \"Friend or Foe\" too. \"Friend or Foe\" for the gigs I do, always makes the crowd go crazy. Soon as they hear it come on, it's on. \"Friend or foe yo, state your biz\nYou tint the door, ah, there it is\" Even when he says \"you tint the door?\" I drop the fader and it's silence, and the whole crowd go \"and there it is\" like in unison. And that's the proper place to drop the fader to see if they're following along cause they're die hard fans of those songs. Yeah \"Friend or Foe's\" heavy.\n\n[Musical Interlude \"Friend or Foe\"]\n\nKyambo \"Hip Hop\" Joshua: He said he was only gonna make one album, so it was really like he put everything in and he had his whole life to make it. And the producers that worked with him were people that knew him for years, so he made like 10 or 20 songs with them before he even made the ones that were on Reasonable Doubt. At least the bulk of them, like Clark Kent and Ski. They both had a lot of songs with Jay so their whole sound had a chance to get refined. And by the time we finished it off with Premier and a couple of other producers there was already a sound\n\nDJ Premier: Ski was a major part of Reasonable Doubt being that he was already around Jay with Original Flavour so once his section of the album was placed, he to me is the root of it. I was the icing pretty much, so, to close it out. But you heard it once you popped it again and again, we talking CDs and cassettes back then. Cassettes are a huge part of our culture. We come from riding in cars and having a big radio, we used to having a big radio on our shoulder or down here to walk with, or having a ride with a big system. So I gear everything towards that, so that's my mentality even now, I love driving, I drive all the time, just to bang out and listen to dope music. Reasonable Doubt is one of those that will carry you to your destination and back.\n\nMemphis Bleek: Look where it took us. That album took us on tour with U2. It took us to Africa to do Water for Life. Bring clean water to villages that didn't have. That album got us able to do a 9/11 charity show to give back to families, after Columbine, the spectrum is enormous. It took him to the White House, you can stop there.\n\nJonathan Mannion: So the first time I went to Roc-A-Fella offices, kind of ripped through the book, and you know Jay was like this is dope, you know I went in to see Dame and he was like \"flip flip through the book\" like two or three pages and he was like \"alright cool, how much are you charging?\" And I was like \"oh man like I dunno, cover my expenses, let me do what I want to do, and execute my creative perfectly, and I'll do it for $300 less than the next lowest bid.\" And he looked at me crazy. What does that even mean? 300 less than the? What are you even talking about? It wasn't really about the money, that's what I told him, I just want to do it, I need this chance to set the pace, the ideas I have are crazy. That's when the album was originally called Heir to the Throne, and from there it switched to Reasonable Doubt the following day. I think ultimately it ended on being classic portraits, it really established him as this Brooklyn, already established OG. It's clean its sharp its styling. We wanted to create something that was lasting, that we could have taken on that day in 1996 or yesterday in 2016. When the title switched and it became Reasonable Doubt, it was like OK, he knew who he was and was really confident in the album, he's always been one to allow people to discover for themselves, cause he felt like when you discover it for yourself it becomes part of you and then you represent i harder because you decided to love it. \"Dead Presidents\" was the first I ever heard, and as soon as I heard it, with the two different versions, I was like he's out of here,  I fought so much harder to get the album because of that, even though I hadn't heard the rest of the album, which ends up being such an incredible complete thought.\n\nSki: I was at this music conference, and Nas had just dropped Illmatic, and everybody was out there playing Nas' album on the strip, and every car was going past playing \"Whose world is this\" and I was like \"Yo this song is crazy!\" So I just kept listening to the record and I was like damn when I get home I want to find something similar to that, that vibe, so I started digging, dropped the needle, found the [?] sample, chopped it up, I put Nas vocals in there to hear if he would fit. I was like yeah that's that vibe. Then I played it for Jay, and when Nas' vocals came I said \"Don't worry about that, Imma take that out.\" He was like \"Nah keep that, that shit is dope\" and that's how it came out, and you know, he killed it.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \"Dead Presidents II\"]\n\nSki: Yeah mean, we definitely got paid for the work we did, they took care of us. I remember getting on the train with the backpack, with 20 grand in the back pack on the train, if people would have known I'd have been done.\n\nEmory Jones: You know, the statute of limitations, but you know, it was one of those things. We was hustlers. You know. You gotta figure like this: Wouldn't you rather get paid cash money than get jerked about somebody telling you we need to do this deal with you, and we need to check these royalties and never see them? Soon as you got this cash money you go play them bills quick.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \"Can I Live\"]\n\nEmory Jones: \"Can I Live\" means so much because, as I said it goes back to us in Vegas and real, you know ringside at the Tyson fight, and we see B.I.G. and Puff, and Dr. Dre sitting in front of us, and it was like y';all really here ring side. The lyrics alone were like, that's where my nickname Vegas Jones come from. \"We at the crap table the one that starts a G up.\" \"This way no Fraud Willies present gambling they re-up.\" That was me. I stand at the Craps table, two chicks with me, one with a bottle of Dom, one with a bottle of Cristal, I'm up 20 thousand, that's a free trip. That was a moment in time we was just on our mojo, in the streets, living life and just doing what we do.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \"Can I Live\"]\n\nJonathan Mannion: From start to finish, you may not like everything, but it's like a complete thought ,delivered, executed perfectly without the pressure of anybody telling you what to do. It's just what felt right for him, and all the people he surrounded himself with.\n\nSki: The music is just honest. It was from your heart. Anytime when you speaking the truth when you being honest about whatever you do people gonna feel it. That's all it was. Honest lyrics, honest creativity always resonates. No labels, nobody telling us how to do it. This creative freedom, just being your own person, your own boss, in whatever you do. And just not being afraid to do your thing, to express whatever you need to express however you're gonna express it.\n\nEmory Jones: That album has a spot in my heart forever. It's the sound of the heart, when you got the family you got the kids, you got mom, you got God but I have Reasonable Doubt. I thin kit represents that culture of what we are, who we are, the world is set up to give the Good, the Bad, the Ugly, some of you might like it, some won't, but that was a language that we know a lot of people spoke.\n\nSki: It's relatable you know? There's still people out there hustling they want to get theirs. They're on their entrepreneur shit, they need that motivation, they need their \"Politics as Usual,\" they need those songs, that get you up and make you want to do stuff, and give you inspiration to keep on pushing for what you pushing for, and this a good album for that, it just embodies that energy.\n\nTyran \"Ty Ty\" Smith: Jay and I grew up together in Marcy Projects. I lived in 552, he lived in 530 something. Like across the park from me. I used to set up battles, I used to talk so much shit to other rappers around the neighbourhood, Jay would be out of town and I would just have battles set up on the other side of the project, and Jay come back I don't even know he back and someone say \"yo be back\" and I'd be like \"oh yeah,\" and I just call him out the window, and Jay would come down and he would go battle these guys. And he never once even asked me who we going to battle, or I'm busy I got shit to do, he knew I was talking so much shit he had to back me up. I don't think there was one person that didn't think that Jay was the best rapper in the world, out of our whole crew. Whatever I had to do, it was never a problem, you just gotta be humble and do it. If you believe in someone it's not even a thing, you just do it. I remember passing out CDs to people you know in Atlanta in the mall passing out Jay's CDs I was down for all of that cause I wanted it to work.\n\nGee Roberson: Oh man 17 John St was the hub of it all. Like it was this small office, that was in the Wall Street area, a staff of about 8 of us, and you know it's amazing cause just think about this, you have a staff of 8 doing the job of 200, making it happen, everybody was just a family, huddled up, rolling out full steam to make it happen, on one accord, pushing one goal, just to drive the album, push the album. I was the intern,m straight out of college, so I'm starting at the bottom grinding, making it happen, just playing my part, my role.  So I was calling every college radio station, every college rep, that was one hat I wore. And then that hat morphed, remember with a staff of 8 you do more than one thing. I was wearing the radio hat  for the day, and then when I left the office to do the field work, as far as I would do retail promotion, so at the time I would go to all of the local mom and pop record stores and make sure the posters was on the windows, make sure we were getting prime placements. at the time we were going up against everybody, it wasn't a situation of the Jay Z of today, it was like \"Who's he? Who's that?\" It was more so turning the \"who is that\" to \"I'm the one.\" In all reality as the record was growing, Jay was on the road, he had to win people over, and he would do whatever it takes to win that crowd over. From spitting acapella, to throwing a stack in the crowd, whatever it took to win that crowd to walk out of there, oh \"who was that guy? This Jay-Z guy is real, this Jay-Z guy is crazy, oh my goodness I just left this Jay-Z show\" like he had the presence of mind from day one to always know I don't care how many people in here know me, I don't care how many people in here don;'t know me, I know one thing, I'm gonna walk off this stage with everybody knowing me. That drive and that focus when it came to his show from day one, that was something instilled in him, that was just part of his DNA.\n\n[Musical interlude: \"22 Two's\"]\n\nTyran \"Ty Ty\" Smith: Rapping to Jay was probably the easiest thing, he probably didn't realise, I don't know he never said, but if you can do something so easy, you can look at it like it's amazing cause it comes natural to you. Everyone else is looking at you like \"this is sick.\" Jay's a smart guy, so he's looking like \"I can do something with this\" you know?\n\nDJ Clark Kent: I knew Jay and Jaz since we were all teenagers, through a guy named Fresh Jordan. And I always thought they were the best MC's I ever heard, so I wanted to sign them no matter how it was supposed to happen. It just never happened for Jaz, so Jay hit the streets running, it worked out for him, it was never a \"yeah I'll go back to that,\" he was unfind-able. When you making that paper, the only people you gonna let find you is the connect maybe. He didn't just have the best rhymes he had the other part that makes the rhymes believable. Try to imagine knowing that for 8 years in advance, then trying to find somebody, and then trying to convince him \"let's do this records,\" and him going \"eh, that's what you do this for? I had that already.\" It's crazy when you know this guy's talent it out of this world. When I finally got in contact with him, it was make records, but let this guy manage you, because of how relentless Damon was. He was dead serious about these artists whether they were good or not, so it was really to me a good idea to introduce him, so that Jay wouldn't have to think business. All he had to think about is making the best records. I would say it's the most right thing I've done in the music business, because I wasn't gonna let any of these A&R's tell me he wasn't the one. And I just didn't quit.\n\nPeter Panic: I'd already put out house records and reggae records,  independently, and as like the only college dude in the whole crew I was already researching where to press records, who is the cheapest as far as printing, where to go get your mastering, I started helping Damon with that part way before. It was him trying to shop the material to majors after a while it became obvious that nobody was biting. There was one meeting between Damon and Clark Kent at 1am at Clark's house, and Damon was explaining the frustration with regards to getting the industry to realise Jay is a dope MC. They decided they wanted to put it out independently, and Clark explained to Damon that putting a record out independently is totally different than putting it out with the support of a label, financially as well as administratively.\n\nDJ Clark Kent: It's partly Maria Davis' album too, she let us perform every week. It was Ty Ty's album cause he held him down, it was B High's album cause he was his cousin that wouldn't let nothing happen to him. It was the Lexus dealers album too cause he was the one who was like yeah we'll let you get the car. It was everyone's album cause it all made what you hear, what you hear.\n\nPeter Panic: Everybody's hopes and dreams and aspirations are pumped into those records, and I think when the listener listens to that, they can feel that, that earnest that you have when you're working on your first album, it;'s a lot of a hope, mixed with a lot of doubt, mixed with a lot of determination. Nobody else kind of put that  into their music as far as like educational value, let me tell you how to move in these streets. He captured it perfectly, it's going to touch recurring generations.\n\n[Musical Interlude: \"Feelin' It\"]", "year": "2016-06-25"}, {"artist": "JAY-Z", "album": null, "title": "Reach the Top", "lyrics": "[Produced by Clark Kent]\n\n[Hook: Jay-Z and DJ Clark Kent]\nGotta reach the top (You gotta persevere)\nCan't wait another year\nI gotta reach the top (Yo Jay, your time's near)\nI gotta reach the top; fuck that, my time is here\nYeah!\n\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nI came up far so brothers can know my name\nI paid so many dues now I'm looking for change\nToo many years wasted\nToo many years on the set seeing the flavors, but I never did taste it\nI gotta reach the top before I'm done with it\nSo much hard work now its time to have some fun with it\nI got my eyes on the number one nigga\nWatch your spot on the charts, \"Here I come nigga!\"\nYou hear the footsteps, you hear the sound\nThe only way I got to go is up the only way you got to go is down\nNow relax on your laurels I ain't faking jack\nSo with your $8.99 plus tax spent on my wax\nYour Freud, paranoid\nBrothers afraid to be unemployed because Jay-Zs' ready to play with the big boys\nI gots to get it, 'til then I won't stop\nToo many years rock bottom, I gotta reach the top\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nI gots to give them lots of rhythm\nWhen all hell breaks loose I'm performing exorcisms\nLurking in the shadows\nReady to put work in\nA hurting on competitions is curtains\nI scheme like a coke fiend\nKeep brothers awake like codeine\n'Cause when you sleep I dream deep, right?\nBrothers better sleep light\n'Cause I keep sight on number one, so go 'head, sleep tight\nI put them out, conspire like I won the house\nThings are looking up, so brothers better be looking out\nI'm closing the gap like Heidi\nMy shits selling more than Shay Whitey\nI'm coming for your spot nigga\nAin't nothing calm about the things on my mind\nShit, I leave here sunny 'cause I won every time\nYou had your time now it's my turn to rock\nAnd let my cream rise\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nI just won't stop there\nI gotta maintain the status quo of being the baddest bro\nThe world is watching\nGirls clocking my rhyming\nI cracked the oyster took the pearl but can I keep it shining?\nToo much passes the flame\nToo much knowledge to ascertain\nI made a mark but can I leave a lasting name?\nWell put this in your pipe and smoke it\nAs long as I'm breathing, I keep the world open\nI skip to the lou so don't sip the soup\nThen get gassed 'cause then, damn, I gotta rip your crew\nMy format is all that so skip the small chat\nIf you're all that then reach for the stars nigga!\nI recycle them bars, hot like stolen cars\nClaim peace if anything brothers is holding off\nI got to have it till then I won't stop\nSo many years rock bottom I gotta reach\n\n[Hook]", "year": null}, {"artist": "JAY-Z", "album": "The Blueprint 3", "title": "Real As It Gets", "lyrics": "[Intro: Jeezy]\nYeah, see it's that\nIt's that Blueprint 3 shit right here\nIt's that TM 103 shit right here\nYou ready?

Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately? The negligent, erroneous reports and attacks on my character, intentions, and the spirit of this collaboration have forced me into a statement I didn\u2019t want to make without the full facts. Making a decision prematurely to pull out of this project, wouldn\u2019t hurt Barneys or Shawn Carter, but all the people that stand a chance at higher education. I have been working with my team ever since the situation was brought to my attention to get to the bottom of these incidents and at the same time find a solution that doesn\u2019t harm all those that stand to benefit from this collaboration.\n\nI am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgements, no matter who it\u2019s towards, aren\u2019t I committing the same sin as someone who profiles?

Those findings are not yet available.\n\nWhile I await the findings of the Attorney General\u2019s Office, I have agreed to move forward with the launch of BNY SCC collection under the condition that I have a leadership role and seat on a council specifically convened to deal with the issue of racial profiling. I am in a unique position to use my voice to affect change to this disturbing issue. The easy position would have been to walk away and leave policy making to others hoping that someone addresses the problem. I will not leave the outcome to others. I will take this into my own hands with full power to recommend, review and revise policies and guidelines moving forward. I am choosing to take this head on.\n\nAs I previously stated, the collaboration with Barneys has always been about giving and The Shawn Carter Foundation.

Drugs were bad, fried your brain and drug dealers were monsters, sole reason neighborhoods and major cities were failing. Nobody wanted to talk about Reaganomics and the ending of social safety nets. The defunding of schools and the loss of jobs in cities across America.\n\nYoung men like me who hustled became the sole villains and drug addicts lacked moral fortitude. In the 1990's incarceration rates in the US blew up, today we imprison more people than any other country in the world; China, Russia, Iran, Cuba. All countries we consider autocratic and repressive, yeah more than them.\n\nJudges hands were tied by tough on crime laws, and they were forced to hand out mandatory life sentences for simple  possession and low level drugs sales. My home state of New York started this with Rockefeller laws, then the feds made distinction between people who sold powder cocaine and crack cocaine even though they were the same drug, only difference is how you take it, and even though white people used and sold crack more than Black people, somehow it was Black people who went to prison.\n\nThe media ignored actual data to this day, crack it's still talked about as Black problem. The NYPD raided our Brooklyn neighborhoods while Manhattan bankers openly used coke with impunity. The war on drugs exploded the US prison population disproportionately locking away Black and Latinos, our prison populations grew more than 900%. When the war on drugs began in 1971 our prison population was 200 thousand. Today it is over 2 million.\n\nLong after the crack era ended we continued our war on drugs. There were more than 1.5 million drug arrests in 2014, more than 80% were for possession only. Almost half were for marijuana. People are finally talking about treating addiction to harder drugs as a health crisis, but there is no compassionate language about drug dealers, unless of course we're talking about places like Colorado whose state economy got a huge boost by the above ground marijuana industry.\n\nA few states south in Louisiana they're still handing mandatory sentences for people who sell weed, despite a booming and celebrated 50 billion legal marijuana industry, most states still disproportionally hand out mandatory sentences to Black and Latinos with drug cases. If you're entrepreneurial living in one of the many states that are passing legalize laws you may still face barriers participating in the above ground economy. Venture capitalists migrate to these states to open multi billion dollar operations, but former felons can't open a dispensary. Lots of times those felonies were drug charges, caught by poor people who sold drugs for living but are now prohibited from participating in one of the fastest growing economies. Got it?\n\nIn states like New York where holding marijuana is no longer grounds for arrest, police issue possession citations in Black and Latino neighborhoods at a far higher rate than other neighborhoods. Kids in Crown Heights are constantly stopped and ticketed for trees, kids at dorms in Columbia where rates of marijuana use are equal or worse than those in the hood are never targeted or ticketed. Rates of drug use are as high as they were when Nixon declared this so-called war in 1971.\n\nForty-five years later it's time to rethink our policies and laws.

Know what I\u2019m saying? Just being who he is. He\u2019s the first Black president. If he speaks on any issue or anything, he should be left alone. I\u2019m not gonna say anything bad about him. Of course, we\u2019re gonna challenge him to do better, but I felt that Belafonte just went about it wrong, the way he did it in the media and then bigged up Bruce Springsteen or somebody, and it was like, whoa, you just sent the wrong message all the way around. You know what I\u2019m saying? You bigged up--Bruce Springsteen is a great guy, you know what I mean?--you a civil rights activist and you just bigged up the white guy against me in the white media. And I\u2019m not saying that in a racial way, I\u2019m just saying what is, the facts of what it was. And it was like, that was the wrong way to go about it.\n\n[Wilson]\nToday, President Obama made a statement about Trayvon Martin...\n\n[Jay Z]\nAmazing, amazing, amazing. Because it\u2019s hard in politics to really just make a statement as a human. I felt today he was very admirable because he made a statement as a father and as a black man and as someone who had compassion for the things that we go through because he\u2019s been through it before. It\u2019s certainly not normal. You know, a politician is not supposed to speak like that.\n\n[Wilson]\nHe went out of his way to address it...\n\n[Jay Z]\nNo, not address it; he really gave facts about clutching purses. We\u2019ve never heard that! We never heard that come out of a president\u2019s mouth. You know, so, that was big, really admirable. I really have another level of respect for him, to be in that position and make that stance, because that\u2019s what I want to do, I want to be in this position and still talk about what\u2019s right and wrong. I\u2019m not gonna always be right; I\u2019m not gonna always do the right thing. But I\u2019m trying. That\u2019s my whole goal, is to maintain a sense of myself and also I want to represent us. I want to represent us in a way we\u2019ve never been represented before.\n\n[Wilson]\nWhat are your thoughts on Trayvon?\n\n[Jay Z]\nI was really angry. I didn\u2019t sleep for two days. I was really angry about it. We all knew there was still a bit of racism in America, but for it to be so blatant was\u2026 if you just asked the questions, asked yourself the question, \u2018Didn\u2019t Trayvon have a right to stand his ground?\u2019 He was being chased, he was being chased and he fought back. He might\u2019ve won, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a criminal. he won. If you chase me, and you try to attack me, and I defend myself, how can I be in the wrong? This guy went to get Skittles and go back and watch the All-Star Game. He had plans. Get an Arizona and get the skittles and watch the game. You know, he probably had his whole position...he had no intentions of robbing anyone's home. You know? So, it's just a thing where, again, a reminder that we still have a long way to go. It's beautiful now, because this generation, they don't see color in that way. We're a bit removed from those racist feelings because, again, it's hard to teach racism when your child is out...you know, our clubs is integrated, the music we listen to is the same.\n\n[Wilson]\n..went to the Jay Z/JT show.\n\n[Jay Z]\nExactly. All our feelings and all our anxieties are more similar now, so you have hope that this generation don't see racism that way, but you still see the old guard, the whole thing that I'm fighting against, that old guard and their old ideas and their stubborn ways and all their ego and all that bullshit. It's still there and it still exists, you know, and you just hate to believe that even a part of it has got to be about business. You know, they're funding George Zimmerman because people want to hold onto their guns, so the NRA is like...you just start...you're mind can go so many places, why the verdict came down the way it came down and we all know it was wrong. It was wrong, this guy was not a professional. First of all, you're not a professional to profile someone. I'm a professional, law enforcement officer, and I'm taught not to profile. This guy's a novice, this guy's a fucking mall cop. You can't assess the situation and figure out what you're going to do, that's not what you do for a living. And even the law, that Stand Your Ground law, you can have a fight with someone, and if they're running away, you can shoot them and kill them, and you're fine? That's not...can we...what?? Let's say...come on...come on man. Someone's robbing your house and they leave and you can shoot them on the way out? They don't possess a threat to you at that point. How? How is that self-defense?\n\n[Wilson]\nYea. I know you dedicated \"Forever Young\" at the shows to him, and stuff like that. The Trayvon situation.\n\n[Jay Z]\nYeah because his memory will live on, right, it'll be...hopefully it'll be...of course, you feel horrible for his parents, that they had to lose their kid, but hopefully this is the moment that changed that law and changed the way we interact with each other. You hate that a child had to be sacrificed for that.\n\n[Wilson]\nWhen you made \"Fuck Up The World\", I know you watch CNN, it was a rebellion act that you saw that kind of inspired that.\n\n[Jay Z]\nYeah the Arab Spring and everybody, how they were standing up and speaking for themselves all around the world, you know, Egypt and whether right or wrong, people now have this platform to say, \"we're not going to allow your politics to get in the way with the way people feel and how the people should be represented.\"\n\n[Wilson]\nIt's funny cause they say how personal Magna Carta Holy Grail is, but you could call it political in a lot of senses. Like, that song \"Somewhereinamerica\", you could take the catchphrase of Miley Cyrus twerking and that's catchy, but it's humor and wit, with a deeper message behind it.\n\n[Jay Z]\nYes, and that's the thing, like reviews...think about trying to get that line. You hear that Miley Cyrus, you're going to come to the wrong conclusion that you really understand the story. People are like, \"why's he saying 'Miley Cyrus' in the song?\" Don't you understand? It's hard to understand the intention behind it. Again, it uses wit and it's catchy, but the real story is about racism. The whole song is, somewhere in America, you can't teach racism when your child is connected to the culture. It's very hard to...\n\n[Wilson]\nShe could be any white girl in middle-America.\n\n[Jay Z]\nExactly.\n\n[Wilson]\nLearning a black dance, or a Hip Hop dance.\n\n[Jay Z]\nRight\n\n[Wilson]\n\"Jay Z Blue\" obviously...you made \"Glory\" right after you had your child, and that seemed like..\"Glory\", the title itself is a very positive kind of glorious thing, and then you look at \"Jay Z Blue\" and there's a very dark vibe to it. The \"Mommie Dearest\" sample [incoherent], why do you feel like you wanted that type of song to represent that?\n\n[Jay Z]\nIf you think about the timing, it's life, right? When your baby first comes, it's only joy. It's only joy, it's like, \"oh my god, look at this.\" It's fascinating that two people can create a life, \"this is real,\" and you know, so it's only glory. It's all joy. Then after that kicks in, you sit with yourself, like, \"am I going to be a good dad?\" I know I have the DNA of my dad, and I know it's not just me and my dad. This is an ongoing problem within our community, how do I get around it? So all those fears and all those anxieties start setting in. I mean, if you intend to do it the right way, the correct way, then you got to really think about it. So those first days was glorious, it was all joy, and now I have to really do the work and make sure I don't repeat that cycle, because I do have my father's DNA, and I'm sure he didn't set out to leave. Actually, he married my mom. It wasn't like he just left day one, he married my mom. He tried, you know? Just, life got in the way. His brother got killed, drugs got into play, so all these things got into play that he couldn't see, nine years out, what was going to happen in life. I'm sure he went into it with the best intentions, the same we all do, and it didn't work out. I don't want that to happen, so let me talk about it. Let me deal with these feelings, let me deal with these emotions, and let me work on it. Let me work it out. So \"Jay Z Blue\" is pretty much that, \"father never taught me how to be a father/treat a mother/I don't want to have to just repeat another/leave another.\" You know, that's the story in a nutshell.\n\n[Wilson]\nWhat's the statement on you putting \"On The Run (Pt. II)\" on the album?\n\n[Jay Z]\nBesides it being really dope?...[laughter]...Again, it's just a showcase of...there's very few relationships in Hip Hop music. There's a lot of, \"I took your girl, and I'm gonna take her again,\"..[cross-talk]..You know what I'm saying? I don't know if people are properly absorbing what I'm doing here. Like I don't know, in the context of...\n\n[Wilson]\nMaking marriage cool in some sense.\n\n[Jay Z]\nJust being honest about it, and putting those sort of subject matters in Hip Hop records. You know? That's not normal.\n\n[Wilson]\nA record like \"On The Run\"? We wouldn't have got that 3 years ago, 4 years ago...\n\n[Jay Z]\nYou would of got \"Big Pimpin'\"\n\n[Wilson]\nThe relationship being such a high profile relationship, there's people that feel so invested in a positive way, and hate on it because of the negative [criticism]..that's how society is. Is it interesting to be on that forefront where, you know, you have to deal with everybody else's feelings and how much they're impacted by what you're doing and just living your life?\n\n[Jay Z]\nI tend not to think about it. If I'm talking about it, we're having a conversation about it, it comes up, I think about it, but everyday when I'm walking around, I don't think about it at all. I know I'm living my life right. I just live my life right, and go about it the right way, and everything will sort itself out. If I'm on the side of right...\n\n[Wilson]\nBut \"On The Run\" is a celebration of it in some sense.\n\n[Jay Z]\nThat's what I mean, so I know I'm on the right, so I'm cool..[laughter]..but if I do something wrong a little bit, my Karma is immediate. My karma is immediate, I'll know. I'll know because something will happen, and it'll be like, \"oh, that wasn't the right shit to do, I apologize.\" [laughter]\n\n[Wilson]\nWell I'm glad you decided to do this man, I hope it was the right decision [laughter].\n\n[Jay Z]\nHey, facts only..[laughter]", "year": null}, {"artist": "JAY-Z", "album": "The Black Album", "title": "Threat", "lyrics": "[Produced by 9th Wonder]\n\n[Intro: Cedric the Entertainer]\nYo, what's up, pimp, this Threats\nThat's right, that's the, the that's, this Threats, pimp\nAnd I'm serious about mine, I'm so sincere\nAnd I, nigga I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up\nPut ya inside the mattress like drug money, nigga\n\n[Intro 2: JAY-Z]\nYeah, I done told you niggas 9 or 10 times, stop fuckin' with me\nI done told you niggas, 9 albums, stop fuckin' with me\nI done told you niggas with the 9 on me, stop fuckin' with me\nYou niggas must got 9 lives\n9th Wonder\n\n[Verse 1: JAY-Z]\nPut that knife in ya, take a little bit of life from ya\nAm I frightenin' ya?

Maybe it was just that time for Jeezy for to move on from the label.\n\nInterestingly, Jay Z was the one who initially signed Jeezy to Def Jam back in 2005. Jay was serving as the label's president at the time. While president of Def Jam, Jay Z also signed Rihanna who is now signed to Roc Nation. Jay recently signed West Coast artist DJ Mustard to Roc Nation.\n\nThe parameters of the deal between CTE and Roc Nation are unclear at the moment. Rumors have been going around that Jay Z and Jeezy may be joining forces to form a new management company, which will house Jeezy and his artists.\n\nJeezy's It's Tha World Vol. 2 is expected to be released November 27th.\n\nWhat do you think about this deal?
