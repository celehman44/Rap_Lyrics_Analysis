'bout who got next\nClaiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet\nHopping all over beats without going through training camp\nTry studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at\nYour songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre\nYou recycle the same quotes, you're not\nSwitching your flow, your flow in the same place\nDon't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps\nMy rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych\nLike an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?\nThe metaphors I write\nIn fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show\nDon't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo\nA gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc\nA Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino", "year": null}, {"artist":

than prayer\nCause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair\nAnd your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care\nAt the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares\nSearching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong\nJust know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room\nI watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost\nAnd wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before\nMaybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better\nBut what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever\nSo the next time you feel like

seen the shock on their faces like \"damn it, he made it\"\nMy luck in the palm of a cherry bomb and they waitin' to blow up on me, my homies are not alarmed\nThen I heard someone's firearm make a

I'm like \"this the loss I'ma take\"\nMy fate was distraught, a cape and some superpowers can't save me\nI'm probably pushing up daisies before I can make my way to the car\nCross cancel and right

I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y\u2019all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit.

We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.\n\nIt turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his \"little bro\"\u2014a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.\n\nSo today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. \"It all happened when I was overseas,\" he says. \"I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.\"\n\nIt's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds\u2014one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever\u2014and since then his legend has spread fast.\n\nIt actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album\u2014about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing \"that crazy-ass girl Sherane\"\u2014is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest\u2014the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house\u2014and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast\u2014Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness\u2014but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song \"Control\"\u2014a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself \"the king of New York,\" which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.\n\n\"Control\" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.\n\nKendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it \"back to the set\" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. \"It can be complicated and confusing,\" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. \"From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous\u2014I still live in this world.\" And when someone back home needs something, \"I still gotta get that phone call.\"\n\nIt's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.\n\nA bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: \"When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow.\" Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: \"Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.\"\n\n\nOn the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over \"Control\" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on \"Control,\" and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of \"Hold On, We're Going Home,\" Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. \"You watch,\" he joked, \"I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!\"\n\nI asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. \"Pretty cool.\" Shrugs. \"And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't.\"\n\nA month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the \"Control\" thing: \"You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'\u2014pretending like nothing ever happened.\" Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped \"Control\" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.\n\nI got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out\u2014\"Control\" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. \"Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis,\" Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, \"No\u2014peer. If anything. We all peers.\"\n\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.\n\n\"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now\u2014it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette.\"\n\nThe visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. \"It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin',\" he explains. \"I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle.\"\n\nMuch of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos\u2014some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton\u2014and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. \"When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets\u2014nobody never really knows,\" he says. \"But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.\"\n\nA few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, \"Aw, man, I can't go to no club.\"\n\nKendrick spoke up.\n\n\"We have to go.\"\n\n\"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go.\"\n\n\"You know me,\" Kendrick explained. \"I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. \"You guys seem so calm,\" I said.\n\n\"Well,\" Tiffith told me, \"we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.\"\nThe gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati\u2014Jay, Bey\u2014mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the \"King of New York\" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. \"It was all love at that party,\" he told me on the private jet.\n\nAfter we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenn\u00e9 Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: \"We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.\"\n\nBy the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency\u2014Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK\u2014a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.\n\nIt's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be.\"\n\nAt one point on good kid Kendrick raps, \"I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous\". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art?

Dot from Compton\nMan Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'\nBut I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me\nUntil I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet\nMe at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour\nTold me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour\nJay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape\nWas skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed\nBut we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap\nDid our first collaboration on the Nephew track\nHe got signed months later, Warner Brothers\nWe started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper\nBefore Sidekicks became a modern day phone\nSame time our buzz was generated from G Malone\nHe had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it\nSaid that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget\nNow that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life\nBut not knowing how to market it right\nTurned on the radio\nOnly cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop\nAnd by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous\nIn the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft\nWhat the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up\nIt was a hit\nWhen I heard it\nBut all we had was the instrumental and the hook\nBut when\nRock jump on it for certain, it was to smash\nGave it to Julio, just to get his opinion\nNext thing you know, the record was\nSpinning\nThat was a good look, it set the coast on fire\nNiggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot\nThen these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station\nAsk why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?\nShit was funny to us tho\nNiggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo\nIn the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy\nI had a situation with Def Jam, premature\nShit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care\nI was glad Jay-Z gave me respect\nSee I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock\nFar as radio play, obvious, he got a lot\nBeefing\u2019 with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it\nWhich in my opinion, I didn\u2019t think the shit was impo\u2019tant\nBut that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother story, we hit the lab with Game\nAnd a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy\nDid the cypher freestyle and everybody\u2019s like, \"Wow\"\nThese Top Dawg niggas \u2018bout to make noise\"\nSurely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that\nBut right after that, we didn\u2019t see him no more\nG Malone came with a

that\u2019s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight\nTell \u2018em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice\nThen Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin\u2019 the internet\nBut he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about\nAnd all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too\nIt finally started to look like the West was makin\u2019 moves\nWestern Union had the whole block boomin\u2019 because of Snoop\nMatter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group\nThen ?Problem? took off, another Compton native\nWe both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it\nBy this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves\nWe almost got into some major beef over Lil\u2019 Wayne\nThat part I'mma leave out\nTheres certain things that the streets only should know about\nShout out to Nipsey\nBishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O\nThat\u2019s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me\nBecause they didn\u2019t see my views, grab the hottest album

something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe\u2019s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat\u2019s your perspective on that?\nPac?

Or even excluding the word, I hate the word \u201cfamous.\u201d I\u2019m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it\u2019s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others\n\nI had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, \u201cTry to completely throw away your ego.\u201d How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places\u2014the big spots, all the events, the lights\u2014it\u2019s all for your ego. It\u2019s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I\u2019m somebody. But truthfully, you\u2019ve always been somebody. You don\u2019t need the lights\n\n\n\n\nI try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what\u2019s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I\u2019m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can\u2019t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it\u2019s not just me you\u2019re focusing on now when I\u2019m out in public, but also on individual characters that I\u2019m talking about in my music. So that\u2019s a whole other ballgame and it\u2019s just something that I\u2019ve gotta accept\nWhen I\u2019m completely drained of inspiration, that\u2019s when I\u2019m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it\u2019s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom\u2019s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I\u2019d never think that would happen, but it\u2019s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can\u2019t drive that thing no more. And she\u2019s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the day-to-day. It\u2019s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it\u2019s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it\n\nI\u2019d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, \u201cThis is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I\u2019m finna put it to you in a whole album\u2014from Compton, from the hood, from the streets\u2014it\u2019s a whole other perspective and light, I\u2019ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and \u2019Pac did it. And I\u2019ma tell my story.\u201d Then I wrapped up with it and said, \u201cMan, what\u2019s on the radio right now? I don\u2019t think they doin\u2019 skits and things like that.\u201d I don\u2019t know if the people are gonna understand what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about on this album because it\u2019s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain\u2019t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least\n\n\n\n\nMy whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don\u2019t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn\u2019t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, \u201cMan, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don\u2019t know. Y\u2019all sure I\u2019m right?\u201d\n\nI was nervous because I didn\u2019t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it\u2019s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, \u201cNever feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.\u201d This is his words verbatim, he said, \u201cWatch what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d\nI believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I\u2019ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn\u2019t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family\n\nBecause that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that\u2019s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn\u2019t satisfied. I\u2019m looking around like, this is great security, but I don\u2019t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that\u2019s in need. But at the same time, I\u2019m feeling like, okay, what\u2019s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, \u201cThank you.\u201d And them being able to recite them lyrics\nKendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played \u201cBitch, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe\u201d for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I\u2019m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, \u201cPlay some stuff .\u201d I can\u2019t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I\u2019m gonna be influenced and I don\u2019t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it\u2019s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It\u2019s selfishness for sure, but it\u2019s my selfishness and I own it\n\nI know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don\u2019t take back, I don\u2019t regret. That\u2019s how I was feeling at the time and that\u2019s how y\u2019all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that\u2019s how I look at it\n\nFrom 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper\u2019s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin\u2019 barbarian. That\u2019s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper \u2019cause this is around the same time where cats weren\u2019t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn\u2019t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that\u2019s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer\u2019s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that\u2019s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It\u2019s the art of writing\nSo you ask yourself in the midnight hour, \u2018Who am I? Is this really what I\u2019m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What\u2019s my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I\u2019m obsessed with it. And that\u2019s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I\u2019m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That\u2019s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that\u2019s something that I hold dear\n\nWhen I\u2019m completely drained of inspiration, that\u2019s when I\u2019m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn\u2019t tamper with, I\u2019ve already had done, that\u2019s when I\u2019m done and I know I\u2019ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I\u2019m drawn away from it, that\u2019s when I say, okay, let\u2019s take all these pieces\u2014they might not even be songs\u2014let\u2019s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s the best part because the things that I say on my records\u2014this is another reason why I don\u2019t just play records for people\u2014you won\u2019t necessarily get it until it\u2019s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I\u2019m not an artist that\u2019s gonna give you a single and say, \u201cThis is what my album\u2019s gonna sound like, go sell it.\u201d That\u2019s not me. I\u2019m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that\u2019s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don\u2019t want to jump in somebody else\u2019s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I\u2019m inspired\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there\u2019s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don\u2019t necessarily scare me. It\u2019s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: \u201cDr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.\u201d\n\nThank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back\n[Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn\u2019t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn\u2019t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you\u2019re saying, \u201crap,\u201d that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep\n\nI found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It\u2019s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I\u2019m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that\nWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, \u201cWho am I? Is this really what I\u2019m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What\u2019s my responsibility?\u201d It\u2019s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it\u2019s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don\u2019t necessarily change, it\u2019s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don\u2019t care about them or you don\u2019t fuck with them no more when that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019re just more focused on what you have to do because it\u2019s bigger\n\nThe moment I start seeing change in people around me, that\u2019s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there\u2019s tension in the air that I probably can\u2019t necessarily deal with at the moment. \u2019Cause when the industry don\u2019t understand me, and the business don\u2019t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can\u2019t run to them?\n\nArtists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I\u2019m always paranoid. I\u2019m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you\u2019re put into a space where you feel like you can\u2019t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day\n\nThe hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It\u2019s almost like you go on the road and you\u2019re gone for two years. And this place you\u2019ve known your whole life, these people you\u2019ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that\u2019s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don\u2019t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being\n\nWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I\u2019ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I\u2019m saying this right now to let everyone know, it\u2019s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity", "year": "2015-01-06"}, {"artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "album": "2011's Freshman Class: The Mixtape", "title": "XXL Freshmen Freestyle", "lyrics": "I return before tables get turned\nIt\u2019s my turn, spur of the moment\nThey re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm\nBumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I\u2019m on it\nI slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent\nYou can\u2019t fuck with the horse power, your woofing too much\nY\u2019all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause\nYou put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl\nYou thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening\nMore reckless than a paisa driving without a license\nHittin\u2019 your new truck then leaving you hiking\nThey said no, the industry let it go\nI cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices\nStickin\u2019 and movin and movin\u2019 and stickin\u2019 the prices\nUppin\u2019 the ante before I'm a antique, can promise you hear me clear\nEven if you eat 3 ears with Tyson\nRippin\u2019 the panties but bootin\u2019 the wammys\nThey dyke and I\u2019m liking them all, I\u2019m siftin\u2019 through panties\nHaters\u2019ll spike it\nVoicing opinions but holding laryngitis\nBut I don\u2019t hear \u2018em, I\u2019m a winner by law\nTrack em down like the subway when they sub-par\nSub-zero everytime I jump in the synagogues\nSend the angels, send the God\nI can make you look hard, I know\nI just let the thoughts take its toll\nMore sentences than level four of y\u2019all, Bogard\nGo hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3\nUncle Toms need Tums to stomach atomic bombs\nOr die from my Wizardry\nRZA, GZA, Method Man\nI\u2019m a killer B, killer!
