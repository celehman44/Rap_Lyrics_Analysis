Peace to all, fear none, this is Yasiin Bey. At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I'm being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They're saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they're making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it's not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation's state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they're there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I've made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I'm under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I'm being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It's curious. I haven't broken any law, and I'm being treated like a criminal. I know I'm not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I'm here with my family. I haven't been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily. There's no reason I have to spend any time in the cell. There's no reason I had to have police come to my house, damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport, where nobody arrested me, and none of that ever happened, at all. This is not an administration of justice, and all I seek is to leave the state. I'm not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing, because I'm not- I just wanna go home, and I don't live in America, and I have the right to domicile wherever I please, without fear or without interference\n\nThe state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we\u2019re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just\u2026you know, a money making machine. So, it\u2019s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um\u2026and that's that\n\nPeace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's\u2026I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all\n\nIn summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen\n\nAnd I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and\u2026and\u2026and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach.

I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem. But I'll end with this verse that I wanna put on \"No More Parties in LA,\" if you would kindly allow me, my dear brother Kanye. And shout out to K. Lamar, too; I see you, my dude\nLonely America, crazy America\nLoud ass, country ass, cocaine America\nLethal America, carcinogen, asthma\nCarbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma\nLights and camera, action, surveillance\nHelicopters, teleprompters\nFlossy newscasters, rich, fool, bastards\nWar, migrant workers, cold murder, traffic\nWelcome to Los... stop right there\nBiggie got shot right here\nAngeles\nHollywood, hoes, handguns\n\nPeace to all, fear none.

He was unarmed and shot at 41 times! No unarmed man should be shot at even once! One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago! Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure! I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.\n\nMost of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists. They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth. They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!\n\nThe only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!... A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms', the 'Brooklyns', the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.\n\nWe are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities. We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us. Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man... Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different! And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.\n\nI hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.\n\nNow I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.\n\nPlease stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.\n\nI wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.\n\nI want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.\n\nPeace,\nMos Def", "year": null}, {"artist": "Yasiin Bey", "album": "The Ecstatic", "title": "Auditorium", "lyrics": "[Intro: Mos Def]\nPeace\nPeace peace peace peace peace peace\nPower\nUh\nMad liberator\nDef operator\nRock the data\nAmazin' flavor\n\n[Verse 1: Mos Def]\nThe way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still\nThings are so passionate, times are so real\nSometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke\nSmile on my face but it's really no joke\nYou feel it in the streets, people breathe without hope\nThey goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down their focus\nThe focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp\nAnd the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary\nI speak it so clearly sometimes you don't hear me\nI push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me\nI feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake\nThat I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep\nAnd it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat\nMy presence speak volumes before I say a word\nI'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb\nCradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell\nUniversal ghetto life, holla black you know it well\nQuiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across\nMind is a vital force, high level right across\nSoul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren\nI swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant\nShocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided\nThe world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'\nSuckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em\nAnd the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him\nEverywhere penthouse pavement and curb\nCradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell\nUniversal ghetto life, holla black you know it well\n\n[Hook]\nWhat it is, you know, they know\nWhat it is, we know, y'all know\nWhat it is, Ecstatic, there it is\nWhat it is, you know, we know\nWhat it is, they know, y'all know\nWhat it is, you don't know?

spot in Bangkok\nColder than a pimp Glock, aim shot the frame drops\nPressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop\nTake not life in vain, now how the preacher was saying\nRemember anyway they laid him in the straight box\nDark suit and gray socks the neighborhood is all distraught\nCandle lights upon the news report the families and students saw\nConfused in awe, they weep into each others' arms\nIt's murder\nNew absence from a mother's arm\nEven the warmth from the mother's arms\nCould not keep her son from harm\nFrom standing where the gun was drawn\nOver come done and done he gone, murder\nShell like a bell that rung\nThe blood burst body temperature fell and plunged\nAnd then the time it took the medics to come\nThe breath eased out of his lungs\nAnd his soul eased out of the slums\nAnd the voice eased out of the drums\nThe sireens they gleam they swung, murder\nTelephone wire sneakers hung, murder\nFor the black and young, murder, and the Ave they from\nI am from the block the president did not campaign on\nWhere the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on\nWhere hustlers stretch the yay long\nHustle hard for an outpost to trade on\nFlip it over and make more\nWhere the blocks are yellow taped off\nYoung bloods is trained off for obese to gray zone\nWhere the pressure just stay on\nBut the lights and the heat don't\nThe place where you witness the

an MC was ??quite the?? move\nCause if you said you had skill well then you had to\nShow and prove\nAnd if there ever was a party, son, yo, I would set it\nAnd tell the deejay run the beat from (Ultra-magnetic)\nI grabbed the mic and then I leave the party buzzin\nTellin all my honeys I was Slick Rick's cousin\nWhen they knew I wasn't, but I had no shame\nPa, you know the name, the Mos

talkin about the games that people\nPlay\nI used to sit back and say: yeah indeed, someday\nAnd as I grew older my kung fu grew better\nInstead of shootin the humbles I was shootin ????\nAnd now my time has come\nAnd now hip-hop's an industry polluted by bums\nPosin with guns they're puffin mad blunts\nAiyo, brothers just started rhymin last month\nThey gettin fat deals on any major label\nWhen they only see other people hold the mic cable\nFive years ago when peoples danced to house\nWhen the deejay played hip-hop then you walked out\nBut now you're hard, talkin about you paid mad dues\nI used to see your ass ???? wearin platform shoes\nI ain't confused, who you think you're foolin with that\n????\nYou ain't genuine, so don't waste your time\nRiffin over here cause here ain't no

I think a lot of people get that\nIt\u2019s like when you experience something and uh, it affects you for a long time afterwards\nI guess everything works that way. Certain things have more impact than others\nSometimes it visits you in your dreams or when you\u2019re quiet or just at peace or trying to be at peace\nA lot of soldiers get it. A lot of common people get it\nMost of the time common people are soldiers, that\u2019s just the way it works out\nThis is a soldier\u2019s dream\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nThe other night\nI was tumbling towards an uneasy sleep\nWhere I had discovered myself\nAtop the sweet sticky firmament of my dreams\nDaybreak came and discovered me\nWith my fantasies pasted to my face\n\nI can't look at you right

closely\nThere\u2019s so much about me that I hide\nThat careful eyes will recognize\nIf you look closely you\u2019ll notice\nThat the pattern on this soft broadcloth shirt\nIs made of\nWorking man's blood\nAnd praying folk\u2019s tears\nIf you look closer, you\u2019ll notice that\nThis pattern resembles\nTenement row houses, project highrises\nCell block tiers\nDiscontinued stretches of elevated train tracks\nSlave ship gullies, acres of tombstones\nIf you look closer, you\u2019ll notice\nThat this fabric has been carefully blended\nWith an advanced new age polymer (oh man, that\u2019s nice)\nTo make the fabric lightweight\nWeatherproof, and durable\nAll this\nTo give some sort of posture and dignity\nTo a broken body that is a host for scars\nI am the new landmark\nI am the museum of injury\nSoldiers visit me and admire me quietly\nWhispering among themselves\nYou\u2019re no soldier\nYour soft bright eyes never have to\nSurvey the battlefield\nMuch less its collected relics of which, I am one\nSo, my flesh bullet-ridden remains hidden\nUnderneath these soft fabrics\nWhich I carefully select\nThat stand in for how I used to feel\nFor how I remember feeling\nFor how I dream about feeling\nFor how I feel about you\nAnd now your curious fingers want to search\nBeyond this tender armor\nI can't look at you right now\n\nThis is my rifle\nThere are many like it\nBut this one is mine\n2x\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour eyes are too careful\nCollecting it all arranging it all;\nSurgically, robotically, exactly\nI can\u2019t look at you right now\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter because\nYou can look at me and the longer that\nI don\u2019t return your gaze\nThe harder that your gaze\nStarts to run across my back\nLike a nervous policeman\u2019s hands:\nBrisk, intent, anxious for discovery\nIf discretion is a fortress\nThen you\u2019re threatening to destroy it\nBy simply\nStanding at the gates\nAnd refusing to leave\nI can\u2019t look at you right now\nBut you can look at
